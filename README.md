# Yelp-Camp

The Yelp Campground project is a web application that I developed for users to browse and review different campsites. It allows users to create, edit, and delete campgrounds, and also leave reviews and ratings for the existing ones.

To build this project, I utilized various technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap to provide an intuitive user experience. I also integrated user authentication and authorization using Passport.js.

This project is available on my GitHub repository, where other developers can access the source code and contribute to its development.

By working on the Yelp Campground project, a person can gain valuable experience in building web applications using modern technologies. This project is suitable for both beginners and advanced developers looking to enhance their skills and knowledge in web development.

Thanks
